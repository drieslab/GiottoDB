# Duckling 🐥
Duckling, DuckDB Library for Integrative Genomics, is an R package for working 
with larger-than-memory omics data. Duckling provides solutions for database 
ETL, a generalized backend framework for centralized database connection and 
reconnection, and S4 data representations for matrix, table, and *terra*-based 
spatial polygon and point data.

We are actively developing Duckling and invite you to submit any feedback on
our Github repository.
